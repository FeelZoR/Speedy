# Speedy

This Godot game was made during the 238th one hour game jam available on [onehourgamejam.com](https://onehourgamejam.com/)

The theme was "Two buttons", so you can move using only two buttons on the bottom left of the screen.

You can see the game on [itch.io](https://zor-dev.itch.io/speedy)
